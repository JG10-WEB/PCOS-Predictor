# PCOS-Predictor
PCOS is a common health problem caused by an imbalance of reproductive hormones. Women with PCOS produce higher-than-normal amounts of male hormones. So i have made a PCOS Predictor. I haven't built it from scratch used someone else's code and articles so I don't claim any ownership of this.
