# PCOS-Predictor
PCOS is a common health problem caused by an imbalance of reproductive hormones. Women with PCOS produce higher-than-normal amounts of male hormones. So i have made a PCOS Predictor. I have built it from scratch used previous codes and articles so i don't claim complete ownership of this code that i have made it by myself
